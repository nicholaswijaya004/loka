# Day 2 — Reproduce Problem

**Goal:** Understand data races; build the smallest version of the double-booking bug.

## Measured

### Counter — 1,000,000 increments

| Variant | Expected  | Observed                    | Result                                      |
| ------- | --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Unsafe  | 1,000,000 | 947,231 / 951,880 / 943,102 | ~5% of increments lost, different every run |
| Mutex   | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000                   | Exact, every run                            |

Benchmark under `-cpu=8`: mutex `X ns/op` vs atomic `Y ns/op` <!-- TODO: fill in -->

### Inventory — 10 seats, 500 concurrent attempts

| Variant | Booked | Available | Result          |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | --------------- |
| Unsafe  | 12     | −2        | Overbooked by 2 |
| Safe    | 10     | 0         | Invariant held  |

```text
=== RUN   TestUnsafeInventoryOverbooks
    inventory_test.go:29: seats=10 succeeded=12 sold=12 available=-2 overbooked=2
    inventory_test.go:31: invariant available+sold == seats? true (-2 + 12 = 10)
--- PASS: TestUnsafeInventoryOverbooks (0.00s)
PASS
ok
```

## Understood

- `count++` is load/add/store, not one instruction — races live in the gap.
- Atomics fix single-value ops but can't span "check then act".
- Mutex throughput degrades as `-cpu` rises; that's the cost of exclusivity.

## Tomorrow

Data model + migrations. The lock moves into Postgres.

# Day 3 — Database Layer

**Goal:** Understand and create database on loka repository that will support the simulation of booking

## Query Verification

Following query will help to verify the availability of the inventory

- Query:

```sql
INSERT INTO inventory_units (name, available_units, total_units, currency, price_minor)
VALUES ('Deluxe Cabin', 10, 10, 'IDR', 150000000);
UPDATE inventory_units SET available_units = -1;
UPDATE inventory_units SET available_units = 50;
```

### Results

```text

DETAIL:  Failing row contains (4f5cc513-9559-4c95-880e-2579c910942e, Deluxe Cabin, null, -1, 10, IDR, 150000000, 1, 2026-09-07 16:15:54.910336+00, 2026-09-07 16:15:54.910336+00, 0).

```

## Day 4 — Naive Booking

Built the naive booking endpoint. Sequential behaviour is fully correct:
201 with computed total, availability 10 → 9, 409 when sold out, 404 on
unknown unit, 400 on bad input.

The flow is deliberately unsafe — four separate round trips, no transaction:
GetInventoryUnit → check availability → DecrementAvailability → InsertBooking
The gap between the check and the decrement is the same check-then-act race
as Day 2's UnsafeInventory, now at database scale.

**Prediction for Day 5** (500 concurrent requests against the 1-seat unit):

- successful bookings: \_\_\_
- constraint violations from chk_availability: \_\_\_
- bookings created vs seats actually sold: \_\_\_
  Unlike Day 2, available_units cannot go negative — the CHECK constraint
  blocks it. So I expect failures rather than corruption.

### Day 5 — Concurrency baseline (500 VUs, 10 seats, pool=50)

| Strategy                               | Bookings | available_units | Invariant   | Overbooked |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| `SET available = available - $1` (SQL) | 10       | 0               | 0+10=10 ✓   | 0          |
| `SET available = $1` (Go-computed)     | 500      | 8               | 8+500=508 ✗ | 490        |

Both run against identical code paths apart from one SQL statement.
The CHECK constraint fired 490 times in the safe run and zero times in
the unsafe run — an out-of-date value written absolutely stays within
legal bounds, so the constraint has nothing to reject.

## Day 6 — Idempotency

**Before:**
| | Sequential (2 identical requests) | Concurrent (500 VUs, one key) |
|---|---|---|
| bookings | 2 | 10 |
| available_units | 10 → 8 | 10 → 0 |

**After:**
| | Sequential | Concurrent |
|---|---|---|
| bookings | 1 | 1 |
| available_units | 10 → 9 | 10 → 9 |
| retry response | 200 + Idempotent-Replay, same booking id | 409 in-flight |

500 concurrent retries of one request now consume exactly one seat.

**Mechanism:** the claim is an INSERT, not a SELECT-then-INSERT. Postgres'
primary key lets exactly one through; the other 499 receive SQLSTATE 23505
and learn they lost. No application-level coordination is involved — the
same property that made the CHECK constraint hold on day 5.

**Split observed:** 499 conflicts, 0 replays — the winner was still in
flight when the burst arrived. The sequential test covers the replay path.

Service package coverage: 100% of statements.

## Day 8 — Transaction

**Goal:** Make the booking flow atomic. Day 5 showed the _decrement_ is safe on
its own; the _flow_ is not — decrement and insert were separate statements, each
committing independently.

**The gap, measured before the fix (macOS, Docker Desktop, 500 VUs, 10 seats):**

| Bookings | available_units | Invariant   | Seats lost |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 8        | 0               | 0 + 8 = 8 ✗ | **2**      |

Two requests decremented availability and then failed to insert. The decrement
had already committed as its own statement, so the seats were consumed with no
booking to show for them — unrecoverable without manual intervention.

**After wrapping the decrement and insert in one transaction:**

| Scenario                                 | Bookings | available_units | Invariant     | Errors |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| No injected failures                     | 10       | 0               | 0 + 10 = 10 ✓ | 0      |
| 30% failure injected after the decrement | 10       | 0               | 0 + 10 = 10 ✓ | 5      |

The second row is the demonstration. `FAIL_AFTER_DECREMENT=0.3` makes
`InsertBooking` fail _after_ the decrement has executed. All five rolled back:
the seats were returned and the requests failed cleanly. Before the transaction,
the same injection consumed seats permanently.

Idempotency still holds through the transactional path — 500 concurrent requests
sharing one key produced 1 booking and 499 conflicts, unchanged from day 6.

**The design problem.** The service needs to say "run these operations
together," so `booking.Store` needed a transaction method. But
`storage.Store.WithTx` takes `func(*storage.Store) error` — a concrete type —
and putting that in the interface would leak the implementation the interface
exists to hide.

Solved with an adapter at the composition root:

    type storeAdapter struct{ *storage.Store }

    func (a storeAdapter) WithTx(ctx context.Context, fn func(booking.Store) error) error {
        return a.Store.WithTx(ctx, func(tx *storage.Store) error {
            return fn(storeAdapter{Store: tx})
        })
    }

Struct embedding promotes every `*storage.Store` method automatically, so the
adapter only has to supply the one method whose signature differs. `storage`
never imports `booking`; `booking` never names `*storage.Store`. The only file
aware of both is `main.go`, which is where wiring belongs.

The re-wrapping in the closure matters: passing the bare `tx` would hand `fn`
something that does not satisfy `booking.Store`, since `*storage.Store` has no
correctly-shaped `WithTx` of its own. Wrapping it also means a nested `WithTx`
call reaches the type assertion and fails with a clear error rather than
silently doing the wrong thing.

**Understood:**

- `Begin` checks out a pool connection and holds it for the whole transaction,
  not per statement. That is where the latency cost comes from, and it is why
  the payment call in week 4 must sit _outside_ the transaction — a network
  round trip to a provider inside one would hold a connection for as long as the
  provider takes to answer.
- `defer tx.Rollback(ctx)` immediately after `Begin` is the only safe shape. My
  first attempt rolled back only when `Commit` failed, which leaks a connection
  on every `fn` error — and day 5 had 490 sold-out responses per run. Rollback
  after a successful commit returns `pgx.ErrTxClosed` and does nothing, so the
  unconditional defer is safe.
- The `DBTX` interface from day 4 is what made this a small change. Every
  storage method already accepted either a pool or a transaction, so none of
  them needed touching.

**Cost me time:**

- Failure injection hardcoded at 0.3 with no env guard, so three "clean" runs
  were silently polluted before I found it. Now opt-in via
  `FAIL_AFTER_DECREMENT`, defaulting to 0.
- Forgot `make reset` between runs twice; stale availability made a retry test
  look broken when it was not.
- Switched machines mid-project again — Docker, `golang-migrate` and a C
  toolchain all had to be installed on the Mac, and the earlier latency
  baselines are from a different host.

**Tomorrow:** `SELECT FOR UPDATE` as the second of four concurrency strategies,
measured on cost rather than correctness.
